# Starship
Kneat - Starship Challenger

We want to know for all SW star ships, to cover a given distance, how many stops for resupply are
required.
The application will take as input a distance in mega lights (MGLT).
The output should be a collection of all the star ships and the total amount of stops required to
make the distance between the planets.
